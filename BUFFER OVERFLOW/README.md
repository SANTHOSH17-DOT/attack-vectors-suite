Buffer Overflow
===============

### 👉 What is Buffer Overflow ?

A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a memory buffer than its capacity, leading to the overwriting of adjacent memory. This can be prevented by adding bounds checks to flag or discard excess data

### 👉 What is Buffer Overflow Attack

A buffer overflow attack occurs when a program is forced to store more data than its buffer can hold. This leads to the attacker being able to overwrite memory, change the execution path of the program, and gain access to sensitive information or systems. Attackers may also feed input that causes a buffer overflow and replace areas of executable code with their own code, giving them control over the program.

### 👉Types of Buffer Overflow Attacks

Stack & Heap-based buffer overflows: Stack-based buffer overflows are more common & occur when a program writes more data to the stack memory than it can handle. Heap-based buffer overflows are harder & occur when a program writes more data to the heap memory than it can handle. Both can lead to memory overwrites & damaging program execution.

### 👉 What Programming Languages are More Vulnerable?

C and C++ are prone to buffer overflow attacks due to lack of built-in safeguards for memory access and overwrite. Many operating systems like Windows, Linux and Mac OSX use C and C++ code. Languages with safety mechanisms like Java, PERL, JavaScript and C# have reduced likelihood of buffer overflows.

### 👉 How to Prevent Buffer Overflows ?

Developers can prevent buffer overflow attacks by using secure coding practices, such as bounds checking and proper memory allocation, or by programming in languages that have built-in safeguards. Operating systems also have security features, such as runtime protection, to prevent buffer overflows.

Three common protections are :

Protection against buffer overflow attacks includes address space randomization, data execution prevention, and structured exception handler overwrite protection. ASLR randomizes data regions, making it difficult for attackers to locate code. Data execution prevention marks memory regions as non-executable to prevent code execution. SEHOP protects against exploitation of structured exception handling, a system for managing hardware and software exceptions

### 👉 Key Concepts of Buffer Overflow

A buffer overflow error happens when data exceeds the buffer capacity, leading to adjacent storage overwriting. This can result in system crashes or be exploited by cyberattacks. Secure development includes regular testing and using language-level protection and run-time bounds-checking.

### 👉 Buffer Overflow Solutions

To prevent buffer overflows, use secure coding practices such as avoiding functions that lack bounds checking, regular testing, and automatic protection at the language level. Bounds checking at runtime can also help prevent buffer overrun by ensuring that data written to a buffer is within acceptable limits.
