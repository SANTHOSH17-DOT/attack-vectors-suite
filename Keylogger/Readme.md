## This is a keylogger made in python
### It can be extended to advanced level as well for example:
  * adding time at which key was pressed
  * attaching it to an executable file so that it runs whenever that file is executed
  * its scope is immense the only restriction is your imagination !!

## To use this keylogger:
  * run the python3 main.py file
  * and let it run..all the keystrokes made will be stored in the file log.txt
  * the program stops once its terminated or 'esc' is pressed

#### Note: Not to to be promoted for any mal practice, its only for educational purpose.!
