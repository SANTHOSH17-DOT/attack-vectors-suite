# SQL Injections

By taking advantage of programme flaws, SQL Injection attacks (also known as SQLi) change SQL queries and inject malicious code.

## Impacts

- Steal credentials - Through SQLi, attackers can gain credentials, which they can then use to pose as users and access resources.
- Access databases - Attackers can access the private information stored on database servers.
- Delete data: Attackers are able to dump entire tables or delete database records.
