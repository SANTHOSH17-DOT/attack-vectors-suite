TCP attacks
===========

### ðŸ”µ What is TCP Attack?

1. The TCP Reset Attack is a method of disrupting communication by sending fake TCP reset packets to a host.

2. This common attack on the Internet often targets non-cooperative websites and can be used to launch DDoS attacks.

### ðŸ”µ How or TCP Attack Works

1. In a normal TCP connection, the sending computer sends a TCP reset packet (RST) to the receiving computer if it's not actively listening for communication.

2. This occurs when the receiving computer hasn't sent an acknowledgment in a while. 

3. However, in a TCP Reset Attack, the sending computer sends a fake RST packet to disrupt communication.

### ðŸ”µ How to mitigate such an attack ?

1. Servers are still vulnerable to SYN flood attacks despite the improved management of resources in current operating systems.

2. Common mitigation techniques include micro blocks, SYN cookies, RST cookies, and stack tweaking. 

3. Micro blocks allocate a small record in memory for each incoming request, SYN cookies involve responding to requests with a SYN-ACK but dropping the SYN from memory, RST cookies send an invalid SYN-ACK to verify requests, and stack tweaking involves modifying TCP stacks to drop incoming connections or release memory. 

4. All of these strategies require the ability to handle high volume DDoS attacks in the Gigabit range.

### ðŸ”µ Background

1. The Internet is a global network of computers that communicate with each other using protocols like IP, TCP, and UDP. 

2. The Internet Protocol (IP) is the foundation for data transfer on the Internet, while the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used to establish a two-way, reliable communication between devices.

3. When two computers need to exchange data, they use a TCP/IP socket to send a stream of packets.
 
4. This protocol provides a reliable connection-oriented transfer, which is useful for large files like video clips or email attachments. 

5. Web browsing also uses TCP/IP to ensure the reliable transfer of web pages, even if they are small enough to fit in a single packet.
