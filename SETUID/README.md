 SETUID ATTACK
=============

![logo](logo.jpeg)

### 🌟️ Introduction :

"Setuid (set user ID on execution) is a Unix file permission that allows users to run a program with elevated privileges. For example, the passwd command is owned by root and setuid, allowing users to change their password with temporary root access."

### 🌟️ File modes Viewing the setuid permission of a file :

🌟️ "The setuid permission is indicated by an "s" in the "user execute" bit position when using the ls -l command to view a file's permissions. E.g. ls -l /usr/bin/passwd."

* * *

### 🌟️ Setting the setuid permission of a file :

"To set setuid for an executable file, use chmod u+s myfile. Non-executable files with setuid have no effect, displayed as an uppercase "S" in ls -l myfile. To make it effective, add the user-executable permission u+x, which displays the setuid as a lowercase "s" in ls -l myfile."

* * *

### 🌟️ Setgid

"Setgid is set group ID on execution, the equivalent of setuid for groups. It grants file permissions to the group owner, indicated by a lowercase "s" in the "group execute" position of ls -l. An uppercase "S" means setgid is set but has no effect. Accessing a file with setgid is as if the user is a member of the owning group. Setgid for a directory means new files created in it have the directory's group owner, and copied/moved files retain their original group ID."
* * *

### 🌟️ File modes

"Setuid and setgid are represented as 4 and 2 respectively in the high-order octal digit of a file's mode. E.g. 6711 is setuid, setgid, and read/write/executable for owner, executable for group and others. There's also a symbolic representation, e.g. u=rwx,go=x,ug+s. To modify an existing directory tree, use a command such as find /path/to/directory -type d -exec chmod g+s '{}' '\'."

### 🌟️ Effects

"Setuid and setgid flags only have an effect on binary executable files and not on scripts, and their effect varies based on whether they're applied to files, directories, or non-binary executable files."

### 🌟️ When set on an executable file

"Setuid and setgid flags on executable files allow users to run programs with escalated privileges, either as the file owner (commonly root) or file's group. This enhances security by allowing trusted programs to be run with restricted access. E.g. ping command with setuid flag grants users network privileges to execute even if they lack the required permission."

### 🌟️ Security impact

"Setuid and setgid flags raise security concerns when used improperly. It's important to be careful when granting execution privileges to files. Improper use can result in security risks as programs with raised privilege can't be altered by the user, but may still have vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This is why setuid is ignored for shell scripts and why chroot system call is unavailable to non-root users on Unix. To avoid potential security issues, always carefully design programs before setting setuid or setgid flags."

### 🌟️ When set on a directory

"Setgid on a directory causes files and subdirs created within to inherit its group ownership. Directories and files already existing when setgid is applied are unaffected. This allows for easier collaboration among a group of users without needing to set permissions for each file. The setuid permission set on a directory is ignored by most Unix/Linux systems. However, FreeBSD can be configured to interpret setuid similarly to setgid, so files in the directory inherit the owner's user ID. Most BSD-based systems have this behavior as default, but it's not necessary for them."

### 🌟️ Security

"Setuid/setgid bit on executables raises security concerns. Developers must be careful in design and implementation to prevent vulnerabilities like buffer overruns and path injection. An attacker exploiting a vulnerable setuid process running as root can execute arbitrary code with root privileges and compromise the system. The process environment must also be properly sanitized to avoid exploitation through environment variables, as seen in past exploits like the one affecting GNU libc."

### 🌟️ Protecting setuid and setgid Programs

"Setuid programs allow a user to run a program with the permissions of its owner, usually root. If the owner is root, the user executing the setuid program becomes a superuser with access to all system permissions. It's important to design setuid programs carefully to avoid security risks, including back doors and shells. CA ControlMinder can be used to manage setuid and setgid programs, permitting only trusted programs to execute and protecting against unauthorized access."
