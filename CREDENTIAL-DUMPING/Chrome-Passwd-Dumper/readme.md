# Credential Dumping
A credential dumping or password dumping attack is an online attack in which a malicious actor hacks into your device and steals your credentials, typically from the device’s random access memory (RAM). Your device’s RAM stores usernames and passwords that were used by whoever logged into it (your device), typically in plain text (i.e., unencrypted). While the RAM is the most common location, attackers may harvest creds from other places on your device (more on that later). The “dumping” refers to the act of stealing and copying the credentials. Once accessed and copied, the credentials are said to have been “dumped.”
