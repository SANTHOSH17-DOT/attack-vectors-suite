# Attack Vectors Suite


### _What is an Attack Vector?_

>In cybersecurity, an attack vector is a method of achieving unauthorized network access to launch a cyber attack. Attack vectors allow cybercriminals to exploit system vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive data, personally identifiable information (PII), and other valuable information accessible after a data breach.

The most common attack vectors include malware, viruses, email attachments, web pages, pop-ups, instant messages, text messages, and social engineering. However, the number of cyber threats continues to grow as cybercriminals look to exploit unpatched or zero-day vulnerabilities listed on CVE and the dark web, as there is no single solution for preventing every attack vector.

### _Purpose of this Project_ :
This repository contains a collection of cybersecurity attack vectors. I firmly believe that the best way to learn something is to do it & all my experiments with a particular attack vector have been documented in this repo.

### Suggestions :
- Worm
- Trojans
- Email phishing 
- Creeper ransomware
- Keylogger
- Root kit
- Botnets
- Maggie
- Gtbotnet
- I love u 2000 blaster sasser
- Code red
- MyDoom
- Cool web search
- Webshell
- Browser locker
- Highjacking cookies
