Set-UID Concept
• Allow user to run a program with the program owner’s privilege.
• Allow users to run programs with temporary elevated privileges
• Example: the passwd program
$ ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 41284 Sep 12 2012 /usr/bin/passwd
Every process has two User IDs.
• Real UID (RUID): Identifies real owner of process
• Effective UID (EUID): Identifies privilege of a process
• Access control is based on EUID
• When a normal program is executed, RUID = EUID, they both equal
to the ID of the user who runs the program
• When a Set-UID is executed, RUID ≠ EUID. RUID still equal to the
user’s ID, but EUID equals to the program owner’s ID.
